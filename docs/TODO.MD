# ECS
**Must have**
- Insert component in to entity
- Query components
- Put the S in to the ECS (implement systems)
- Benchmarks
- Proper archetype ECS implementation. Once all of the above is implemented, the basic API is there. But the implementation is its most basic form and is not efficient at all. [See this article from flecs ECS creator](https://ajmmertens.medium.com/building-an-ecs-1-where-are-my-entities-and-components-63d07c7da742).

**Nice-to-have**
- Relationships (like parent/child)

**Bugs**
- toComponentType does not guarantee uniqueness for every component

# Window
- Be able to create a window

# Graphics
- Draw a triangle
